        "Sweet is the subtle flavor of grains and roots. Energetically speaking, the direction of this flavor is upward because these plants tonify, build, and energize. Sweet herbs tend to be anti-inflammatory and demulcent, especially when the content of mucopolysaccharides is high. Most saponin-rich adaptogens are sweet as well. This is the energy of earth and water."

        "Sour tastes are often linked to astringent properties. These herbs may help in toning tissues and balancing bodily fluids. The direction of sour moves energy inward and downward. Think cooling, natural lemonade in expansive summer heat. The sour flavor of herbs, though, is more subtle than the intensity of lemons."

        "Stimulating, spicy plants increase circulation and wake up our senses. They help increase digestive action. Aromatics like rosemary and thyme are warming and drying, reflecting the Mediterranean ecosystem they come from. The energy of fire and air from pungent medicines is also specific for lungs, as these elements disperse energy in an outward direction. These herbs can be quite stimulating, so usually they are used in low doses."

        "Bitter flavor has a downward, drying, and clearing action. Bitter cools and clears heat from the body and aids in cases of inflammation. Bitter herbs are often associated with digestive benefits. The bitter receptors on the tongue stimulate a reflex response that provokes an amazing array of actions: increased appetite, increased bile flow, production of hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, protected gut tissues, balanced blood sugar, clearing of dampness from the digestive tract, and a low-level antimicrobial action."

    "heading": "Astrigent",
    "subheading": "Energetics : Cooling, Drying",
    "desc":
        "Astringent is recognized as a taste in Ayurveda, but in other systems it is considered more as a sensation rather than a flavor. Astringent tastes are often drying and can help in toning tissues. They may be used for conditions where there is excess moisture or looseness. Most herbs are slightly astringing due to the presence of tannins. These compounds are prevalent in plants because they are part of the plantâ€™s immune response to disease."
